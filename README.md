This is my first project and was made for the Economics and Finacance club of IIT Guwahati. 
In this project I have made a decentralsied application on Ethereum using using HTML, CSS, Javascript and Solidity.
I also used Metamask, Remix IDE and Ethers.js for the project. 
I created a simple frontend website to deploy solidity smart contract with the help of just two buttons.
